## Introduction
This capstone is intended to predict the likelihood of the Falcon 9 first stage landing successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of $62 million; other providers cost upward of $165 million each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. 

This capstone project is intended to mimic a real world Data Science problem and is my first attempt at putting all my Data Science knowlegde together in one body of work. I have assumed the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup company intending to compete with SpaceX, and in the process followed the Data Science methodology involving

I am tasked with predicting whether or not the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. 

## Business Problem
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if an accurate prediction of the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully can be achieved, it is possible to determine the cost of a launch. With the help of these Data Science findings and models, the competing startup can make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch. 

## Objective
- To apply data science toolkit and machine learning in order to accurately predict the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully, and thus determine the cost of a launch.
- Explore the data in order to obtain more insight from the data.
- To relate findings to stakeholders

## Business metric
Classification accuracy: number of correct prediction divided by the total number of prediction defined as:

$$ Accuracy  =  \frac{TP+TN} {TP+FP+TN+FN} $$

## Deliverables
- Accurate predictive algorithms
- Business case report to stakeholders
